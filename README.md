# [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) (AoC) is a merry event put on by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) every December. The massive event contains a collection of small programming puzzles released daily. Solutions may be solved in the participant's coding language of choice.

This respository consists of my solutions to the puzzles. The user may notice a shift in format as I go. Days 1 through 3 show an attempt to clean up the code somewhat. By Day 4, I started to treat this as an opportunity to show people how I solve problems.
