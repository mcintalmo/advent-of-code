# [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) (AoC) is a merry event put on by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) every December. The massive event contains a collection of small programming puzzles released daily. Solutions may be solved in the participant's coding language of choice.

This respository consists of my solutions to the puzzles.
